Ingenico Challenge

This project is a maven project.<br/>
It could be worked with "spring-boot:run" command after build.<br/>
Project is built as it does not need any database. H2Sql embedded database was used.<br/>
Database could be switched to Mysql, just put up comment lines in application.properties. Also other databases could be used if desired.<br/>
Project default host port is 8099<br/>
Project details is printed as a json file on localhost:8099<br/>

Swagger interface login information : username:gokhan.polat password:gokhan1990 they are specified in application.properties.<br/>
